## Delays
* Processing
* Queuing
* Transmission
* Propagation

---

## Processing delay
Time required to examine the packet's header and determine where to direct it

---

## Queuing delay
Time that the packet has to wait before it gets transmitted through the outgoing link

---

## Transmission delay
Time required to push all the packet's bytes into the link

---

## Transmission delay
* L (length in bits) / R (rate, bits/sec)
* Rate can be 10 Mbps and 100 Mbps

---

## Propagation delay
Time required to propagate from one end of the link to another

---

## Propagation delay
* Speed of propagation is 2-3 * 10<sup>8</sup> meters per second
